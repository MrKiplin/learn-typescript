# TypeScript Coding Tasks

A collection of tasks to solve using TypeScript and TDD (Test Driven Development). Test cases are included for each task.

## Using the Repository

This repository has been designed for intermediate developers who would like to become more familiar with TypeScript. Simply fork/clone to your local machine then navigate to the folder of your chosen task and run the tests `yarn test`. All tests will fail in their initial state. Your objective is to write code that makes all the tests pass.

Happy hacking :)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

To get up and running, you will need the following tools.

#### Code

To write and test code you will need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) installed. If your on a Mac, use [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) for installation.

```
brew install node
brew install yarn
```

Will also need [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) installed.

```
npm install -g typescript
```

### Installing
